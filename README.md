# Fermi Number Guessing Game
## Description
This is a number guessing game called Fermi. The game randomly generates three distinct target numbers from 0 to 9 and the user needs to guess and position the three target numbers in the correct order. The user inputs three numbers via the three textfields, and the application returns a hint to the user consisting of Fermi (one number is a target number and is in the right position), Pico (one number is a target number but is not in the right position), or Nano (one number is not a target number).

The user must guess the correct order of the three target numbers to win the game. When the game is over, the number of guesses taken will be displayed to the user. The game can be reset at any time by clicking the reset button, and a new set of random numbers will be generated.
